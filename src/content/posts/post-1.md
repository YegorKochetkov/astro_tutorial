## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro** on your computer
2. **Making pages** in Astro by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in
   the `src/pages/` folder.
3. **Publishing it to Netlify** for free
4. **Making blog posts** using .md files

## What's next

I will finish Astro tutorial.
